## Description  
This is my personal portfolio that I have designed in order to showcase to
others applications I have worked on and to give a sample of what I have to 
offer. 

Included on my portfolio website are a navigation bar with links to different portions of the website, a picture of me, some information about me, various applications I have worked on including the Horiseon homepage, and various methods to contact me.

_The primary areas of code that were focused on in the creation 
of this portfolio are as follows:_
* Flexboxes
* CSS variables
